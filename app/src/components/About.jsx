	     	 <p>
              I am a recent computer science graduate from Villanova University actively looking for software/web developer roles
               As I start my career, I am excited to bring my skills in building responsive, user-friendly,
               secure, and accessible websites and applications to the company I work for
              I love being in tech because it challenges me to be a continuous learner. 
              I am currently learning React JS and I document my learning journey on Medium.. </p>
              <br/>
              <p>I am also passionate about mentoring and encouraging young kids to learn how to code. 
              Throughout my time at Villanova, I actively served as a lead coordinator for the coding club at St. Francis De Sales School in West Philadelhia 
              where we introduced the students to programming using platforms such as Scratch and Processing.</p>
              <br />
              <p> I recently co-founded <a href= "http://www.steamlabke.com/" target="_blank" className="website-link"  rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
              STEAM-LAB KENYA</a>, an online education service to introduce Kenyan high school students the basics of programming and spark interest in a career in tech </p>
